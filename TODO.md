- [ ] Remove functions from `__init__.py`, put them in a separate, hidden utility file (`_util.py`)
- [ ] Track integral error term! (at least remember it; maybe also check and warn if greater than 0.1 percent?)
- [ ] Can I replace the call to quad with a brute force integral? That would be fast. Or can I continue to add pieces of code to Cython?
- [ ] Add imports of simulation, base, plot, etc to `__init__.py`
- [ ] Implement model II, plus nice unittests for it.
- [ ] Is there any use case for all of the `=None` defaults in calculation code? It seems better to just force the caller to actually specify a value, since the capacitance, etc, are low-level routines.
- [ ] Start adding tests for the various simulation objects, so that I can implement the other model.
